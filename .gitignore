# This is a template .gitignore file for git-managed projects.
#
# Solution: stick this file up your repository root (which it assumes is
# also the catkin_ws root) and add exceptions for any projects,
# and other directories that should be under version control.
#
# See the comments below for more info on how to add exceptions for your
# content. Or see git's documentation for more info on .gitignore files:
# http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitignore.html

# Ignore everything in the root except the "src" directory.
